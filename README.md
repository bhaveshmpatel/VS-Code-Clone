# Visual Studio(VS) Code Clone

A basic clone of Visual Studio Code built using HTML and CSS. This project is a front-end replication that mimics the appearance of VS Code. It's a static project with no functionality, focused solely on recreating the look and feel of the popular code editor.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS**: The project is built using pure HTML and CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, mimicking the responsive behavior of the original VS Code interface.
- **VS Code Interface Elements**: Includes a mockup of the sidebar, editor window, status bar, and other UI elements.
